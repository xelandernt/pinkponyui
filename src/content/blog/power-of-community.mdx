I never thought I'd become a "running person." But when I joined Pink Pony Running Club six months ago, everything changed.

## Finding My Tribe

Running solo was always a chore - something I forced myself to do. But running with the Pink Pony crew? That's pure joy.

### What Makes It Special:
- **No pressure** - run at your own pace
- **All levels welcome** - from beginners to marathon runners
- **Social vibes** - post-run coffee is mandatory
- **Support system** - we celebrate every achievement

## My Journey

When I started, I could barely run 2km without stopping. Now? I'm training for my first half-marathon, and I'm actually *excited* about it!

### Key Milestones:
1. First 5km without walking - Week 3
2. Completed a parkrun - Week 8
3. Running became my favorite part of the week - Week 12
4. Signed up for a half-marathon - Week 20

The best part? I've made friends who genuinely care. We push each other to be better, but never judge. We celebrate victories and support each other through challenges.

**Running together is powerful. Join us and see for yourself!**
