Vienna is a runner's paradise! With its stunning parks, riverside paths, and historic streets, there's always a new route to discover.

## The Donau-Insel Trail

Our favorite spot is the **Donau-Insel**, a 21km long island between the Danube River and the New Danube. The flat terrain makes it perfect for all runners, and the scenic views are unbeatable.

### Why We Love It:
- **Flat and fast** - perfect for tempo runs
- **Traffic-free** - dedicated running and cycling paths
- **Beautiful views** - river on both sides
- **Great community** - always runners and cyclists around

## Prater Park

The historic Prater Park offers tree-lined paths that are especially beautiful in autumn. The main alley (Hauptallee) stretches for 4.5km and is perfect for interval training.

*Join us on our weekly runs to explore these routes together!*
