Winter is here, and we know it's tempting to stay cozy indoors. But winter running can be incredible if you're prepared!

## Dress Smart, Not Heavy

The key to winter running is layering. You should feel slightly cold when you start - you'll warm up quickly!

### The Perfect Winter Running Outfit:
- **Base layer** - moisture-wicking material (avoid cotton!)
- **Mid layer** - fleece or thermal for insulation
- **Outer layer** - windproof and water-resistant jacket
- **Accessories** - gloves, headband, and reflective gear

## Safety First

Winter means shorter days and potentially slippery conditions. Here's how we stay safe:

### Essential Safety Tips:
1. **Be visible** - wear reflective gear and lights
2. **Watch your footing** - be cautious on icy paths
3. **Warm up longer** - cold muscles need extra time
4. **Stay hydrated** - yes, even in winter!
5. **Run with others** - our group runs are perfect for this

## Embrace the Cold

There's something magical about running through a winter wonderland. The crisp air, the quiet streets, the sense of accomplishment - it's worth it!
